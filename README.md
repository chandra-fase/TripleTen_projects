| 3 | [Megaline Telecom Operator](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/03-SDA_project) | The project task was to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. |
| 4 | [Software Developement Tools](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/04-Software%20Development%20Tools_project) | The focus of this project was to provide additional practice with common software engineering tasks. |
| 5 | [Ice Video Game Forecasting](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/05-Integrated%20Project%201_project) | The project task was identify patterns that determine whether a video game succeeds or not to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. |
| 6 | [Zuber](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/06-SQL_project) | The project task was to find patterns in the available information to understand passenger preferences and the impact of weather and ride frequency. |
| 7 | [Megaline Machine Learning](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/07-ML_project) | The project task was to develop a model to analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans. |
| 8 | [Beta Bank](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/08-Supervised%20Learning_project) | The project task was to create a model to predict wether a customer would leave the bank soon. |
| 9 | [OilyGiant Mining Company](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/09-ML%20in%20Business_project) | The project task was to build a model to help pick the region with the highest profit margin to place a new well. |
| 10 | [Zyfra](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/10-Integrated%20Project%202_project) | The project task was to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. |
| 11 | [Sure Tomorrow Insurance Company](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/11-Linear%20Algebra_project) | The project task was to predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. |
| 12 | [Rusty Bargain](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/12-Numerical%20Methods_project) | The project task was to develop a model to determine the market value of a vehicle using historical data. |
| 13 | [Sweet Lift Taxi](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/13-Time%20Series_project) | The project task was to develop a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. |
| 14 | [Film Junky Union](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/14-ML%20for%20Texts_project) | The project task was to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. |
| 15 | [GoodSeed Supermarket](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/15-Computer%20Vision_project) | The project task was to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage using. |
| 16 | [Final Project](https://github.com/chandra-fase/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/16-Final%20Project_project) | The project task was to build a prototype of a machine learning model by; makning a work plan, investigating the task, developing a model and preparing a report. |
